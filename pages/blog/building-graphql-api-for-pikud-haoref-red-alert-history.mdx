# Building a GraphQL API for Pikud HaOref Red Alert History

## Introduction

Access to critical information during times of crisis can be a matter of life and death. Pikud HaOref (Israel's Home Front Command) plays a vital role in alerting citizens about imminent security threats, particularly through its red alert system. In this blog post, I'll guide you through the process of building a GraphQL API that provides seamless access to Pikud HaOref red alert history data. By harnessing the power of Cloudflare Workers, GraphQL Yoga server from The Guild, and GraphQL, we'll create a scalable and efficient solution for accessing this crucial information.

## Setting Up the Project

To kickstart our project, we'll utilize a combination of powerful tools and technologies. Cloudflare Workers will serve as our serverless execution environment, offering the flexibility and scalability necessary to handle dynamic workloads. Additionally, we'll incorporate GraphQL Yoga server from The Guild, which provides a robust framework for building GraphQL APIs with ease. Leveraging GraphQL, we can define a flexible and intuitive schema for querying red alert data efficiently.

## Fetch the Data

Our journey begins with fetching red alert data from Pikud HaOref's official sources. We'll start by defining a function to retrieve alerts from today using an endpoint provided by Pikud HaOref's website. This function will handle HTTP requests, ensuring proper error handling and data parsing to provide a seamless experience for our users.

```typescript
// Fetching alerts from today
import { GraphQLError } from "graphql"

export async function alertsFromToday() {
  const url =
    "https://www.oref.org.il/WarningMessages/History/AlertsHistory.json"
  const headers = {
    "X-Requested-With": "XMLHttpRequest",
    Referer: "https://www.oref.org.il/12402-he/Pakar.aspx",
  }

  try {
    // Fetch data from the provided URL
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
  }
}
```

## Set Up the GraphQL Schema

Next, we'll define our GraphQL schema to structure the data and operations available through our API. We'll focus on queries for fetching alerts from today, last week, last month, and within a specific date range. Additionally, we'll specify the structure of alert objects, including fields such as date, title, location, and category.

```typescript
// GraphQL schema definition
type Query {
    allAlertsFromToday(orderBy: OrderBy!, typeBy: TypeBy, first: Int, after: String): AlertConnection!
}

type AlertConnection {
    edges: [AlertEdge!]!
    pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type AlertEdge {
    node: Alert!
    cursor: String!
}

type PageInfo {
    hasNextPage: Boolean!
    endCursor: String
}

type Alert {
    date: String
    title: String
    location: String
    category: Int
}

enum OrderBy {
    CREATED_AT_DESC
    CREATED_AT_ASC
}

enum TypeBy {
    MISSILES
    UAV_INTRUSION
    EARTH_QUAKE
    RADIO_LOGICAL_EVENT
    TSUNAMI
    HAZARDOUS_MATERIALS
    TERRORIST_INFILTRATION
    DRILL_MISSILES
    DRILL_GENERAL
    DRILL_EARTH_QUAKE
    DRILL_RADIO_LOGICAL_EVENT
    DRILL_TSUNAMI
    DRILL_UAV_INTRUSION
    DRILL_HAZARDOUS_MATERIALS
    DRILL_TERRORIST_INFILTRATION
    UNKNOWN
}

input AlertsInput {
    fromDateTime: DateTime
    toDateTime: DateTime
}
```

## Run the Process and Explore with GraphiQL

As we run our GraphQL server, we're greeted with the powerful GraphiQL interface. GraphiQL provides an interactive playground for exploring and testing our API in real-time. With its intuitive autocomplete feature and built-in documentation, GraphiQL streamlines the process of querying our GraphQL schema, enabling us to iterate quickly and efficiently.

```typescript
// Creating the Yoga server with schema and resolvers
const yoga = createYoga<Env>({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: gql`/* GraphQL schema definition */`,
    resolvers: resolvers,
  }),
  graphiql: {
    defaultQuery: /* GraphQL */ `
      query AllAlertsFromToday {
        allAlertsFromToday(orderBy: CREATED_AT_DESC, first: 10) {
          edges {
            node {
              category
              date
              location
              title
            }
            cursor
          }
          pageInfo {
            hasNextPage
            endCursor
          }
        }
      }
    `,
  },
})
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building a GraphQL API for accessing Pikud HaOref red alert history data provides a valuable resource for citizens and researchers alike. By leveraging the power of Cloudflare Workers, GraphQL Yoga server, and GraphQL, we've created a scalable and efficient solution for accessing critical information during times of crisis. The combination of advanced technologies and best practices in API development ensures a seamless experience for users, empowering them with timely access to essential information.
