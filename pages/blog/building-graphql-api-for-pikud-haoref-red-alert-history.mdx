# Building a GraphQL API for Pikud HaOref Red Alert History

## Introduction

In times of crisis, timely access to critical information can be a matter of life and death. Pikud HaOref (Israel's Home Front Command) plays a vital role in alerting citizens about imminent security threats, particularly through its red alert system. In this blog post, I'll embark on a journey to build a GraphQL API that provides access to Pikud HaOref red alert history data. Leveraging the power of Cloudflare Workers, GraphQL Yoga server from The Guild, and GraphQL, I'll create a scalable and efficient solution for accessing this crucial information.

## Setting Up the Project

To begin my project, I rely on a combination of powerful tools and technologies. I utilize Cloudflare Workers as my serverless execution environment, providing me with the flexibility and scalability needed to handle dynamic workloads. Additionally, I incorporate GraphQL Yoga server from The Guild, which offers a robust framework for building GraphQL APIs with ease. By leveraging GraphQL, I can define a flexible and intuitive schema for querying red alert data efficiently.

## Fetch the Data

My journey starts with fetching red alert data from Pikud HaOref's official sources. I begin by defining a function to retrieve alerts from today using an endpoint provided by Pikud HaOref's website. This function handles HTTP requests, ensuring proper error handling and data parsing to provide a seamless experience for our users.

```typescript
// Fetching alerts from today
import { GraphQLError } from "graphql"

export async function alertsFromToday() {
  const url =
    "https://www.oref.org.il/WarningMessages/History/AlertsHistory.json"
  const headers = {
    "X-Requested-With": "XMLHttpRequest",
    Referer: "https://www.oref.org.il/12402-he/Pakar.aspx",
  }

  try {
    // Fetch data from the provided URL
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
  }
}
```

## Set Up the GraphQL Schema

Next, I define my GraphQL schema to structure the data and operations available through my API. I focus on queries for fetching alerts from today, last week, last month, and within a specific date range. Additionally, I specify the structure of alert objects, including fields such as date, title, location, and category.

```typescript
// GraphQL schema definition
type Query {
    allAlertsFromToday(orderBy: OrderBy!, typeBy: TypeBy, first: Int, after: String): AlertConnection!
}

type AlertConnection {
    edges: [AlertEdge!]!
    pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type AlertEdge {
    node: Alert!
    cursor: String!
}

type PageInfo {
    hasNextPage: Boolean!
    endCursor: String
}

type Alert {
    date: String
    title: String
    location: String
    category: Int
}

enum OrderBy {
    CREATED_AT_DESC
    CREATED_AT_ASC
}

enum TypeBy {
    MISSILES
    UAV_INTRUSION
    EARTH_QUAKE
    RADIO_LOGICAL_EVENT
    TSUNAMI
    HAZARDOUS_MATERIALS
    TERRORIST_INFILTRATION
    DRILL_MISSILES
    DRILL_GENERAL
    DRILL_EARTH_QUAKE
    DRILL_RADIO_LOGICAL_EVENT
    DRILL_TSUNAMI
    DRILL_UAV_INTRUSION
    DRILL_HAZARDOUS_MATERIALS
    DRILL_TERRORIST_INFILTRATION
    UNKNOWN
}

input AlertsInput {
    fromDateTime: DateTime
    toDateTime: DateTime
}
```

## Run the Process and See GraphiQL

As I run my GraphQL server, I'm greeted with the powerful GraphiQL interface. GraphiQL provides an interactive playground for exploring and testing my API in real-time. With its intuitive autocomplete feature and built-in documentation, GraphiQL streamlines the process of querying my GraphQL schema, enabling me to iterate quickly and efficiently.

```typescript
// Creating the Yoga server with schema and resolvers
const yoga = createYoga<Env>({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: gql`/* GraphQL schema definition */`,
    resolvers: resolvers,
  }),
  graphiql: {
    defaultQuery: /* GraphQL */ `
      query AllAlertsFromToday {
        allAlertsFromToday(orderBy: CREATED_AT_DESC, first: 10) {
          edges {
            node {
              category
              date
              location
              title
            }
            cursor
          }
          pageInfo {
            hasNextPage
            endCursor
          }
        }
      }
    `,
  },
})
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building a GraphQL API for accessing Pikud HaOref red alert history data provides a valuable resource for citizens and researchers alike. By leveraging the power of Cloudflare Workers, GraphQL Yoga server, and GraphQL, I've created a scalable and efficient solution for accessing critical information during times of crisis. The combination of advanced technologies and best practices in API development ensures a seamless experience for users, empowering them with timely access to essential information.

As I continue to refine and optimize my GraphQL API, I'm committed to providing a reliable and accessible platform for accessing Pikud HaOref red alert history data. Through ongoing innovation and collaboration, I aim to enhance the resilience and responsiveness of my system, ensuring it remains a trusted source of information for years to come.
